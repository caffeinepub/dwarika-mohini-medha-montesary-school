# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a multilingual (English/Hindi) school website for Dwarika Mohini Medha Montesary School, Shuklaganj, Unnao, with class listings, a contact form, and a warm traditional visual theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Full-screen language selection modal on page load (English / Hindi), with language toggle in the header persisting the choice for the session
- Hero section displaying the school name "Dwarika Mohini Medha Montesary School", location "Shuklaganj, Unnao", and a tagline — all in the selected language; includes school logo and hero banner image
- Classes section with cards for Class 1 through Class 5, each showing class name, age range, subjects, and a short bilingual description
- Contact Us section with a form (Full Name, Email, Phone Number, Subject, Message), field validation, bilingual labels/placeholders, backend persistence of submissions, success message, and form reset on success
- Warm earthy color palette (saffron, deep green, cream/ivory), serif headings, sans-serif body text, rounded cards, responsive layout

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors land on a language chooser, pick English or Hindi, then browse the fully translated school site — exploring class information and submitting contact inquiries that are saved to the backend.
