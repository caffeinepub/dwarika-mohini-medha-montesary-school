  "summary": "The diff implements nearly all requirements: language modal (REQ-1), hero section with school name and location (REQ-2), classes section with 5 class cards (REQ-3), contact form with backend persistence (REQ-4), warm earthy visual theme (REQ-5), and logo/banner images from the correct path (REQ-6). Minor gaps exist around the success state button not being translated. Overall implementation is solid and complete.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "All user-facing strings on the page change based on the selected language",
      "reason": "In ContactForm.tsx, the 'Send Another Message' button after successful submission is hardcoded in English and does not use the translation system, violating the requirement that all user-facing strings change based on selected language.",
